    "### Automatic Memory Allocation: Python uses a dynamic memory allocation mechanism to manage memory for objects. When you create an object in Python, the necessary memory is allocated automatically based on the object's type and size. This allocation and deallocation of memory are handled by the Python runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Garbage Collection: Python utilizes a garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced or in use. The garbage collector keeps track of objects and their references and periodically identifies and frees up memory that is no longer needed. This helps prevent memory leaks and reduces the burden of manual memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Counting: Python uses reference counting as a fundamental mechanism for memory management. Each object in Python has a reference count, which is incremented when a new reference to the object is created and decremented when a reference is deleted or goes out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero, it means there are no more references to it, and the memory occupied by the object can be freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cycle Detection: In addition to reference counting, Python employs a cycle detection mechanism to handle cases where objects reference each other in a cyclic manner, preventing the reference count from reaching zero. The cycle detector identifies and collects cyclically referenced objects that are no longer reachable, ensuring their memory is reclaimed."
